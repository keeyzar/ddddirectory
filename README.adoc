= DDD directory structure creator

This is a simple plugin, which lets you create a directory structure for your project. Mark an existing directory as a root directory, and all the child directory names are saved. You can now create a new directory like that.

For example:

[literal]
- root
-- child1
--- grandchild1_1
--- grandchild1_2
-- child2
-- target

Now you mark root as root, go to another directory(e.g. target), press `Alt+Insert` and select "Create directory structure". This is the new structure

[literal]
- root
-- child1
--- grandchild1_1
--- grandchild1_2
-- child2
-- target
--- child1 # new
---- grandchild1_1 # new
---- grandchild1_2 # new
--- child2 # new
--- target # new
